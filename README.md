# 🌟 React Vite + TypeScript Project Documentation 🚀

## 🎯 Overview

I'm using this project as a learning resource to understand how to build React applications using **Vite** and **TypeScript**. The focus is on structuring projects with reusable components while leveraging TypeScript for type safety and more robust development practices.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔥 **Vite + TypeScript Integration:** Setting up a fast development environment with Vite, powered by TypeScript to prevent errors and improve code quality.
- 📦 **Modular Component Architecture:** Understanding how to organize a React project using reusable components for cleaner, more maintainable code.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-link]
   cd project-directory
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using Yarn:**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## 🛠️ Project Structure

```
/src
  ├── components   # Reusable UI components
  ├── main.tsx     # Initializes and renders the app
  ├── index.tsx    # Handles app structure and entry logic
  └── App.tsx      # Root component of the application
```

### 🔍 Component Structure

- **components/**: Contains modular, reusable UI components.
- **main.tsx**: Connects the app to the DOM and initializes rendering.
- **index.tsx**: Manages the app structure and entry logic.
- **App.tsx**: The main component that defines the application's layout and flow.
